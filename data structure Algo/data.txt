some explaination of the most important concepts in data structures 
- what is data structure? is about elements in memory arranged linearly  each one is attached to his adjoint and previous element in the array 
- there are four fundamental types in data structure 
which are : arrays , linked lists , stack , and Queue 

- (1) arrays are satatic dtat structure limited in size once its declared the  elements inside the array are indexed from 0 to n 

-Efficient Iteration: Can loop through elements in O(n) time.
 - arrays can be described  in 1 dimention or n dimentions ( matrix)

- the most important algorithms in arrays are :
Reversing an Array O(n)
Finding Maximum     and  Minimum O(n)
Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick)
Searching (Linear, Binary Search)
Shifting and Rotating an Array


-(2) linked lists : 
contrary to arrays linked lists are dynamic structure it can change it's size during excution they are not indexed 
findding indexex in the linked list require the entire traversing through elements  one by one which slows down the searching increasing the time of excution
  
-(3) stack a type of data stucture which follows the last in the first out principle the last element added to the stack is the first one 
to be removed ; on the top of the stack we can add element through the push operation or remove it through the pop operation 
when we want to get the top element we use peek operation.


-(4) the Queue : is a linear data stucture that follows the first in first out principle the first element added will be the first one removed 

-(5) hash tables : A hash table is like a super-fast notebook where we  store things using a label (key) to find them quickly. Instead of searching through everything, it jumps straight to the right spot using a special formula (hash function).

It’s great for quick lookups, but sometimes two things try to go in the same spot (collision), so extra steps are needed to organize them.
 but hash tables has an extra feature it can increase their size in memory when necessary and reduce it when possible
Hash tables are used in things like dictionaries and databases to find data fast.

 
the performance analysis! we talka bout two!
 
  is the way we search  for the best algorithm like the best way and optimised one to solve a problem 

the insertion sorting!:
Insertion Sort (Simple Explanation)
Insertion sort works like sorting playing cards in your hand.

Start with the first card (already sorted).
Pick the next card and place it in the correct position among the sorted ones.
Repeat for each new card, shifting cards as needed to make space.it works perfectly in small lists.

-(6) what is merging sort!:

Merge Sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It works by:

Splitting the list into smaller parts until each part has just one element.
Merging the small sorted parts back together in the correct order.
It’s fast and efficient, especially for large lists, but it uses extra memory to store the divided parts.
